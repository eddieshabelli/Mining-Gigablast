# Mining-Gigablast
This program reads a text file 'terms.rtf' for search terms. It then uses Gigablast to search each of those terms. It then saves the html for the first thirty results of each search term in the directory that the .py file is located in.

This program copuld be useful for practicing basic text mining. In this case, our team analyzed the results by using spectral clustering in R.

Gigablast API credentials are necessary for the proper use of this program. See https://gigablast.com/api.html
